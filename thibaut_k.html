    			I'm PhD candidate in Epidemiology at the university Pierre &amp; Marie Curie (Paris 6).
    			My main interest remains in the field of communicable diseases and vaccinology. Especially
    			I'm interested in understanding how pathogens and host biology, environmental variables, and public health interventions, affects infectious diseases dynamics and epidemiology. Iâ€™m currently investigating the relative contribution of seasonal change in meningococcal transmission and the risk of invasive disease given asymptomatic carriage in the observed seasonality of meningococcal meningitis and epidemics meningitis in Africa. Not to mention that I'm also open to other fields of population health. Aside from my PhD research I'm also a teaching assistant in Biostatistics at University Paris 6 and at occasions with MPH-1 students at the &Eacute;cole des Hautes &Eacute;tudes en Sant&eacute; Publique.
