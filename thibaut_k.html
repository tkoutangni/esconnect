    			I'm PhD candidate in Epidemiology at the university Pierre &amp; Marie Curie (Paris 6).
    			My main interest remains in the field of communicable diseases and vaccinology.
    			Iâ€™m currently investigating the relative importance of seasonal change in meningococcal
    			transmission and the risk of invasive disease given asymptomatic carriage in the observed
    			seasonality of meningococcal meningitis and epidemics meningitis in Africa. My future
    			research is to build on the foundations of my PhD and to investigate the effect of serogroup
    			replacement following vaccination, as well as relevant co-epidemic factors such as viral coinfections
    			on population immunity and the occurrence of epidemics meningitis in the African
    			meningitis belt. While i'm primarily interested in improving understanding of how pathogens and
    			host biology, environmental variables, and public health interventions, affects infectious
    			diseases dynamics and epidemiology, I'm also open to other field of population health.
